        "Next, you should try implementing a Spark version of the SGD model trainer.   Your Spark implementation should read a training file, train the model, and then output the model to the `models` folder.  The model output file that you generate should list the weight associated with each feature, with one feature per line, like this:\n",

        "Use Spark's `saveAsTextFile` action to output your model.   For example, if you are training a model for the group_x training set, use `saveAsTextFile(\"models/group_x_model\")`.   This will actually cause Spark to create a folder called `group_x_model`.   In the folder, there will be files with names like `part-00000` that contain the actual output data.  When you use `saveAsTextFile`, Spark will generate one `part-xxxxx` file for each partition of the RDD that you are writing out.   In this case, you should have only a single partition (for the reason described below), so there should be only one `part-xxxxx` file.\n",
        "\n",
        "Training the SGD model is an inherently sequential task, since the training instances update the model one at a time, and each instance's spamminess is computed using the model produced by that instance's predecessors.   This means that the only part of the training that you can parallelize using Spark is the parsing of the input file.   Once the input is parsed, your Spark implementation will have to force all of the instances into a single partition, and then apply the training function to the entire partition.   To see whether you are getting sensible results, you can compare the model you learn with Spark to the one that you learned with your sequential Python program from Question 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "Remember that training should occur entirely in Spark.  The training instances should never come into your driver program.\n",

        "Implement the function `spark_SGD()` below that takes as input the path to the training dataset, an output path `output_model` and a value for the update parameter `delta`, and writes the trained model to `output_model` using Spark's `saveAsTextFile`. You can use it to generate models from all three of the training files, leaving the results in your models folder. For this assignment, you will be using Spark's original RDD interface, rather than the DataFrame interface.\n",
