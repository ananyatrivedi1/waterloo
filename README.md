## CS431 - Data Intensive Distributed Analysis
Hereâ€™s a concise summary of the key concepts, tools, and features used for the CS431 assignments.

1. **Distributed Data Processing**:
   - Fundamental operations with RDDs, DataFrames, and SQL for large-scale data analysis and transformation.

2. **Advanced Querying and Joins**:
   - SQL-like operations, joins, window functions, and aggregations on distributed datasets, both with RDDs and DataFrames.

3. **Performance Optimization**:
   - Use of caching, partitioning, broadcasting, and avoiding unnecessary shuffles to improve computational efficiency.

4. **File Handling and Formats**:
   - Reading and writing data in various formats (e.g., CSV, JSON, Parquet) and schema definition for structured data.

5. **Real-Time Data Processing**:
   - Stream processing using DStreams and StreamingContext, window operations, and real-time analytics on live data streams.

6. **Custom Functions and UDFs**:
   - Implementation of user-defined functions for custom transformations in DataFrames and streaming contexts.
